== Name

mkinitcpio.conf - mkinitcpio configuration file

== Synopsis

_/etc/mkinitcpio.conf_

== Description

mkinitcpio will attempt to read from a configuration file each time it is
invoked, _/etc/mkinitcpio.conf_ by default. This file defines several variables
which describe the contents of the image to be generated. In addition to the "main"
configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read
from _/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/*.conf_. These drop-ins have higher precedence and
override the main configuration file.

== Variables

*MODULES*::
    Defines an array of additional modules which should be added to the image.
    Dependencies (including other modules and necessary firmware), will also be
    added to the image. At runtime, the modules in this array which were
    successfully added to the image will be explicitly loaded.

*FILES*::
    Defines an array of additional files which should be added to the image.
    Files are added as is, and parent directories will be added if needed. Files
    specified in this variable will override previously added files of the same
    path.

*BINARIES*::
    Defines an array of additional binaries which should be added to the
    image. These are assumed to be dynamic ELF binaries, and necessary shared
    library dependencies will automatically be added. However, it is not
    considered an error to specify a non-ELF binary in this variable. Parent
    directories will be added if needed. Files specified in this variable will
    override previously added files of the same path.

*HOOKS*::
    Defines an array of hooks which will be run during the build process.
    Order is important, as it defines the order in which hooks will be run
    during bootup. Use mkinitcpio's *-L* flag to list all available hooks,
    and the *-H* flag to display the help text for a specific hook.

*COMPRESSION*::
    Defines a program to filter the generated image through. The kernel
    understands the compression formats yielded by the *zstd*(1), *gzip*(1),
    *bzip2*(1), *lz4*(1), *lzop*(1), *lzma*(1), and *xz*(1) compressors. If
    unspecified, this setting defaults to _zstd_ compression for Linux â‰¥ 5.9 and
    gzip compression for Linux < 5.9. In order to create an uncompressed image,
    define this variable as _cat_.
     +
    It is not hard to realize that a filter such as a _tac_ or _rev_ will cause
    *mkinitcpio* to report success but generate a useless image. Similarly,
    using a compression program not listed above may generate an equally useless
    image, despite being "valid".

*COMPRESSION_OPTIONS*::
    Defines an array of additional options to be passed to the compression
    program. This option is generally not used. It can be potentially dangerous
    and may cause invalid images to be generated without any sign of an error.

*MODULES_DECOMPRESS*::
    Switch (_yes_/_no_) to decide whether loadable kernel modules and their
    firmware should remain compressed or be uncompressed during initramfs
    creation. Disabled by default to avoid recompressing the files using a lower
    compression and to reduce RAM usage during early boot. Enable to allow
    further decreasing image size when using high compression (e.g.
    *xz -9e* or *zstd --long --ultra -22*) at the expense of increased RAM usage
    at early boot.
     +
    Note that any compressed files will be placed in the uncompressed early CPIO
    to avoid double compression.
